## Neural Networks for Machine Learning

Assignments for the coursera course Neural Networks for Machine Learning given by Geoffrey Hinton and provided by the University of Toronto. Assignments were made in Octave.


This course is about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. It emphasizes both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.
